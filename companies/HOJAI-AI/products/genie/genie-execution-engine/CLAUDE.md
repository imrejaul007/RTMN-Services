## 🔐 Auth (Phase 7)

This service now requires a **Bearer JWT** (CorpID-issued) on every request except `/health`, `/`, and `/ready`. Auth is enforced via `app.use(requireAuth)` from `@rtmn/shared/auth`.

**Get a token:**

```bash
# Dev shortcut (base64 JSON token — matches what requireAuth verifies):
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:4702/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"you@example.com","password":"dev"}' | jq -r .token)
```

**Call this service:**

```bash
curl http://localhost:PORT/health                      # public, no token
curl http://localhost:PORT/your-endpoint \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"                   # protected
```

**Disable in dev/test:** Set `SERVICE_REQUIRE_AUTH=false` env var.

See [shared/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md](../../shared/MIGRATION-GUIDE.md) for the full `@rtmn/shared/auth` pattern and the canonical thin-shim approach.
