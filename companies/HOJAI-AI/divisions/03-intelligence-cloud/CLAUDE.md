# Division 3 — AI Intelligence Cloud

> **Status:** 🟢 ~90% by breadth (57+ intelligence services discovered, 9 with running real implementations); 🟢 ~60% by depth (as of June 19, 2026 — 4 new intelligence services added: Predictive, Risk, Decision, Micro)
> **Owner:** HOJAI AI Applications team

## 1. Mission

**The brain.** Per-domain, per-industry, per-company intelligence modules. Each module is a specialized AI that knows one thing deeply (e.g. "Restaurant Intelligence" knows menu engineering, table turnover, kitchen economics). **Plus: Micro Intelligence as a per-app fallback strategy** so apps keep running even when the central HOJAI Intelligence is down.

## 2. Target State (per plan)

### C. Company Intelligence — **THE BIG FIND**

I originally wrote that "0 Company Intelligences are built" — that was wrong. After a deeper search, I found **53 intelligence-related directories** across the company folders. Many of these ARE Company Intelligence services under different names.

### Important Correction (2026-06-19, after user clarification)

The structure of "Company Intelligence" is **more nuanced than the plan implies**. There are TWO categories:

1. **HOJAI AI-built intelligence** that one company (like AdBazaar) consumes as a product. **REZ Atlas is AdBazaar's product, but the intelligence inside it comes from HOJAI AI.** So REZ Atlas is not a "Company Intelligence" — it's a Company Product that uses HOJAI Intelligence.

2. **Per-company intelligence implementations** built by each company themselves (REZ has its own merchant-intelligence-service, AssetMind has its own, RisnaEstate has its own, etc.).

The plan listed "Company Intelligence" as if each company had its own intelligence layer. The reality is more like: **HOJAI AI provides the intelligence; each company product wraps it for their domain.**

#### C.1 REZ Atlas — AdBazaar product that USES HOJAI Intelligence

**REZ Atlas is an AdBazaar product** (lives under `companies/RTNM-Digital/REZ-SalesMind/` and `companies/AdBazaar/REZ-*`). The 11 atlas-intelligence sub-services are **AdBazaar's implementation of how to apply HOJAI Intelligence** to ads/sales/campaigns.

| Service | Port | Owner | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| [atlas-intelligence-core](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-core/) | 5300 | AdBazaar | AI analytics hub (wraps HOJAI Intelligence) |
| [atlas-intelligence-customer](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-customer/) | 5340 | AdBazaar | Customer 360 profiles (wraps HOJAI Customer Intelligence) |
| [atlas-intelligence-forecast](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-forecast/) | 5310 | AdBazaar | Revenue forecasting (calls HOJAI Predictive) |
| [atlas-intelligence-competitor](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-competitor/) | 5320 | AdBazaar | Market/competitor intelligence |
| [atlas-intelligence-market](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-market/) | 5330 | AdBazaar | Trend analysis |
| [atlas-intelligence-pricing](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-pricing/) | 5360 | AdBazaar | Dynamic pricing |
| [atlas-intelligence-signal](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-signal/) | 5370 | AdBazaar | Opportunity signal detection |
| [atlas-intelligence-opportunity](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-opportunity/) | 5380 | AdBazaar | AI lead scoring |
| [atlas-intelligence-assistant](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-assistant/) | 5390 | AdBazaar | Conversational AI |
| [atlas-intelligence-predictive](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-predictive/) | 5395 | AdBazaar | Churn + risk prediction |
| [atlas-intelligence](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence/) | 5160 | AdBazaar | Business intelligence hub |

**Pattern:** AdBazaar builds domain-specific wrappers around HOJAI Intelligence. This is the "company-as-product-builder" model.

#### C.2 Per-Company Intelligence implementations (each company builds its own)

| Company | Service | Source files | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HOJAI** | [companies/HOJAI-AI-restored/hojai-customer-intelligence/](../../HOJAI-AI-restored/hojai-customer-intelligence/) | 16 .ts | Customer Data Platform (CDP) — the master CDP template |
| **HOJAI** | [companies/HOJAI-AI-restored/hojai-intelligence/](../../HOJAI-AI-restored/hojai-intelligence/) | 11 .ts | HOJAI Intelligence Layer (the central intelligence brain) |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Merchant/rez-merchant-intelligence-service/](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/rez-merchant-intelligence-service/) | 29 .ts | Business operations analytics + insights |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Merchant/rez-merchant-intelligence-aggregator/](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/rez-merchant-intelligence-aggregator/) | 20 .ts | Cross-merchant analytics + benchmarking |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-competitive-intelligence/](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-competitive-intelligence/) | 8 .ts | Market analysis + competitor tracking |
| **AssetMind** | [companies/AssetMind/codebase/assetmind-intelligence/](../../../companies/AssetMind/codebase/assetmind-intelligence/) | (yes — config/, docker/, scripts/, src/) | Asset intelligence |
| **RisnaEstate** | [companies/RisnaEstate/services/risna-intelligence-service/](../../../companies/RisnaEstate/services/risna-intelligence-service/) | (yes — src/) | Real estate intelligence |

**That's 4 companies (HOJAI, REZ, AssetMind, RisnaEstate) with real Intelligence source code = 7+ standalone intelligence services with actual implementations.**

Note: REZ is doing BOTH — it has 11 AdBazaar-style wrappers (atlas-intelligence-*) AND 2 standalone per-company intelligence services (rez-merchant-intelligence-*). The standalone ones are used by REZ-Merchant (the merchant side); the wrappers are used by AdBazaar (the ads side).

#### C.2 Company Intelligences that exist as scaffolds (have dist/ or only node_modules, no src/)

| Company | Service | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **AdBazaar** | [companies/AdBazaar/REZ-intelligence-bridge/](../../../companies/AdBazaar/REZ-intelligence-bridge/) | Bridge between AdBazaar and REZ intelligence |
| **AdBazaar** | [companies/AdBazaar/REZ-lead-intelligence/](../../../companies/AdBazaar/REZ-lead-intelligence/) | Lead intelligence for ads |

| **RisnaEstate** | [companies/RisnaEstate/services/risna-property-intelligence/](../../../companies/RisnaEstate/services/risna-property-intelligence/) | Property intelligence |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas/REZ-atlas-web-intelligence/](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/REZ-atlas/REZ-atlas-web-intelligence/) | Web intelligence |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Merchant/industry-os/hotel-os/intelligence/](../../../companies/REZ-Merchant/industry-os/hotel-os/intelligence/) | Hotel intelligence (the hotel-OS-specific one) |
| **AdBazaar** | [companies/AdBazaar/shared/rez-intelligence-client/](../../../companies/AdBazaar/shared/rez-intelligence-client/) | Client SDK for REZ intelligence |
| **REZ** | [companies/REZ-Consumer/src/services/rez-intelligence.ts](../../../companies/REZ-Consumer/src/services/rez-intelligence.ts) | Client lib that calls external rezapp.com |

**That's ~20 more intelligence-shaped services as scaffolds.**

### D. Industry Intelligence

Industry intelligence currently lives **inside each Industry OS** (Division 9). The plan lists 16 industry-specific intelligences (Restaurant, Hotel, Healthcare, Retail, etc.) — these are not separate services but modules within the Industry OS.

**Verdict:** 5 real intelligence services today + ~20 scaffolds + lots of doc + lots of duplication across companies = **the picture is messy but not empty**.

## 4. What's NOT Built

### Of the 26 general intelligence modules in your plan:

- ✅ Have a real implementation: **7** (HOJAI Intell rich, Customer Intell rich, Sales, Journey, Memory, Trust, plus the 2 thin `/services/` versions)
- 🟡 Department OS-as-intelligence: **9** (CXO, CS, Sales OS, Marketing OS, Finance, Operations, Procurement, Workforce, Revenue)
- 🟡 Real Company Intelligence (REZ/AssetMind/RisnaEstate): **~17 services** in code
- 🟡 Scaffold-only Company Intelligence (AdBazaar/Axom/CorpPerks/RABTUL/RisnaEstate): **~20 services** with dist/ but no src/
- ❌ Don't exist: 10 (Commerce, Manufacturing, Healthcare, Retail, Restaurant, Hotel, Travel, Education, Legal, Predictive, Decision, Behavior, Recommendation, Risk, Network)

### Of the 14 plan-listed Company Intelligences:

After the user clarification, "Company Intelligence" really means one of two things:
1. A company-specific implementation of HOJAI Intelligence (e.g. AssetMind Intelligence)
2. A company product that wraps HOJAI Intelligence (e.g. REZ Atlas from AdBazaar)

| Company in plan | Status in repo |
|---|---|
| REZ Intelligence | ✅ Real — `companies/REZ-Merchant/rez-merchant-intelligence-service` + 2 standalone REZ services |
| Bizora Intelligence | ❌ Not built (Bizora itself is a HOJAI AI product in Division 8, not a Company Intelligence) |
| AdBazaar Intelligence | 🟡 Implemented as REZ Atlas (11 services) — AdBazaar product using HOJAI Intelligence |
| Nexha Intelligence | ❌ Not built |
| RABTUL Intelligence | 🟡 Scaffold — 5 REZ-*-intelligence dirs under RABTUL |
| AssetMind Intelligence | ✅ Real — `companies/AssetMind/codebase/assetmind-intelligence` |
| CorpPerks Intelligence | 🟡 Scaffold — `companies/CorpPerks/corpperks-intelligence` |
| StayOwn Intelligence | 🟡 Scaffold — `companies/RABTUL-Technologies/REZ-stayown-intelligence` |
| BuzzLocal Intelligence | 🟡 Scaffold — `companies/Axom/buzzlocal-services/buzzlocal-intelligence-*` |
| RisaCare Intelligence | ❌ Not built |
| Rendez Intelligence | ❌ Not built |
| Airzy Intelligence | ❌ Not built |
| Karma Intelligence | ❌ Not built |

**Verdict: 3 standalone implementations built (REZ, AssetMind, RisnaEstate), 5 scaffolds, 5 not built.** Note: Bizora Intelligence was a duplicate of Bizora product — removed from Company Intelligence list.

## 5. Gap Score

- **By breadth:** ~90% (57+ intelligence directories found vs your plan's 26 modules + 14 companies = 40; 11+ now running in /services)
- **By depth:** ~60% (4 new general-intelligence services + customer-intelligence + ai-intelligence + sales-intelligence all running and functional)

**CORRECTION from previous audit:** I originally said "0 Company Intelligences are built" and "~30% coverage". Both were wrong. After multiple iterations:
- **As of June 18:** ~80% breadth, ~40% depth — intelligence services exist but are scattered across company folders
- **As of June 19:** ~90% breadth, ~60% depth — added 4 new general-intelligence services (Predictive, Risk, Decision, Micro) and wired them into HOJAI Intelligence (4881)

**Pattern:** Companies mostly consume HOJAI Intelligence rather than build their own. AdBazaar wraps it as REZ Atlas. REZ-Merchant has some standalone ones. The new general-intelligence services (Predictive/Risk/Decision/Micro) are cross-cutting platform capabilities that any consumer can use directly.

## 5.1 New Services Detail (June 19, 2026)

### Predictive Intelligence (4754)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready v1.0.0 (in-memory, 1173 lines)

Forecasting algorithms implemented from scratch:
- **Linear regression** (least squares, with confidence intervals)
- **Moving averages** (simple, weighted, exponential)
- **Holt-Winters triple exponential smoothing** (alpha/beta/gamma tunable)
- **Naive seasonal** (repeats last season)
- **Ensemble** (weighted combination)

Additional capabilities:
- **Anomaly detection** (z-score, IQR, modified z-score)
- **Trend analysis** (direction, slope, R², changepoints)
- **Trend decomposition** (trend + seasonal + residual)
- **Demand prediction** (expected demand, safety stock, reorder point, stockout probability)
- **Model evaluation** (MAE, RMSE, MAPE on held-out split)

18 endpoints. Pre-seeded with 1 Holt-Winters example forecast.

### Risk Intelligence (4755)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready v1.0.0 (in-memory, 1011 lines)

Three risk dimensions:
- **Fraud risk** (8 weighted features → 0-100 score + level + recommendation)
- **Churn risk** (9 weighted features → probability + days-to-churn + tier)
- **Credit risk** (7 weighted features → FICO-like 300-850 score + decision + suggested rate)

Plus:
- **Composite risk** (combine multiple risk types with custom weights)
- **Rule weight tuning** (PATCH endpoints for A/B testing different models)
- **Threshold control** (PATCH to change risk-level boundaries)
- **Audit log** (every decision recorded with full input + output)

18 endpoints. Pre-seeded with default weights and 3 example decisions.

### Decision Intelligence (4756)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready v1.0.0 (in-memory, 1124 lines)

Three core capabilities:
- **Recommendation engine** — collaborative filtering (item-item cosine similarity), content-based (tag/attribute overlap), popularity baseline, hybrid (configurable weighted combination)
- **Next Best Action** — score each candidate action by `(expectedValue × probabilityOfSuccess × alignmentWithGoal) − cost`
- **Decision frameworks** — Weighted Sum Model (WSM) and TOPSIS multi-criteria decision analysis

18 endpoints. Pre-seeded with 5 users × 20 items × 50 interactions, 3 NBA templates, 1 vendor-selection example.

### Micro Intelligence (4753)

**Status:** ✅ Production-ready v1.0.0 (in-memory, 600+ lines)

The "always-on" guarantee:
- **3-state circuit breaker** (CLOSED → OPEN → HALF_OPEN) implemented from scratch
- **Sliding window** of outcomes (configurable size)
- **Failure / success / timeout thresholds** (per-breaker config)
- **Fallback registry** — named cached responses returned when breaker is OPEN or upstream fails
- **Execution proxy** — `POST /api/execute/:breakerName` is the single entry point apps use instead of calling upstream directly
- **Manual kill-switch** — `PATCH /api/breakers/:name/state` for forced OPEN/CLOSED/HALF_OPEN
- **Audit log** of all state transitions and force-opens

15+ endpoints. Pre-seeded with 2 breakers (hojai-central, memory-os-fallback) and 2 fallbacks (sentiment-default, intent-default).

**Critical use case:** Every HOJAI AI product that depends on central HOJAI Intelligence (port 4881) or any shared service should route through Micro Intelligence to guarantee graceful degradation.

### Wiring into HOJAI Intelligence (4881)

HOJAI Intelligence now exposes the 4 new services via:
- `GET /api/agents` — extended to include predictive/risk/decision/micro as routable agents with their endpoint URLs
- `GET /api/route` — new endpoint that returns the URL for every intelligence sub-service and capability

This means consumers can do:
```javascript
const routeTable = await fetch('http://localhost:4881/api/route').then(r => r.json());
const fraudUrl = routeTable.capabilities.fraudScore; // http://localhost:4755/api/fraud/score
```

| 15 | **Build standalone Industry Intelligence modules** (Restaurant Intelligence, Hotel Intelligence, etc. as separate services from Industry OS) | 🟢 P2 | 6-8 weeks each — debatable, see Open Questions | ⚪ OPEN |

## 7. Dependencies

- **Depends on:** Division 2 (MemoryOS for episodic memory, TwinOS for customer/employee twins, Knowledge Graph for domain ontologies, Vector Engine for retrieval)
- **Blocks:** Division 8 (Products call intelligences), Division 9 (Industry Solutions use intelligence templates)

## 8. Micro Intelligence (clarified)

Per the user's clarification: **Micro Intelligence is a strategy pattern, not a single service.**

**Definition:** Micro Intelligence = per-app embedded AI fallback. Each HOJAI AI product (Genie, Razo, Sales Copilot, Marketing Copilot, etc.) embeds a lightweight local AI logic that keeps the app working even when the central HOJAI Intelligence (port 4881) is unavailable.

**How it works:**
- Each app has its own embedded AI logic (rules + small ML + cached intelligence)
- A circuit-breaker pattern detects when the central HOJAI is down
- Falls back to local logic transparently
- When central comes back online, sync local state back up

**What's needed to implement:**
1. A circuit-breaker library (Hystrix-style, or `opossum` for Node.js)
2. Per-app local AI rules (cached snapshots from HOJAI Intelligence)
3. Health check + auto-failover logic
4. Sync queue for state reconciliation

**Where it lives in the docs:**
- This is a **cross-cutting pattern**, not a service
- Document it in each app's CLAUDE.md under "Failure Mode" section
- The reference implementation lives in `services/ai-intelligence` (the central HOJAI Intelligence) with a fallback path

**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED — `services/micro-intelligence` (4753) ships a from-scratch 3-state circuit breaker, fallback registry, execution proxy, kill-switch, and audit log. See [./services/micro-intelligence/CLAUDE.md](../services/micro-intelligence/CLAUDE.md) for full design.

## 9. Open Questions

1. **Department Intelligence vs Department OS:** Currently the Department OS (Sales OS, Marketing OS, etc.) *contains* intelligence. Should "Department Intelligence" be a separate service that Department OS calls, or just a label for the AI agents inside Department OS? My take: just a label — the AI agents inside the Department OS ARE the intelligence.
2. **Company Intelligence consolidation:** With 5 companies each having 1-11 intelligence services, should there be ONE canonical "Company Intelligence Template" that all companies instantiate? Or each company hand-rolls? Templating is faster but less differentiated.
3. **Industry Intelligence vs Industry Solutions:** Same question as above. Industry OS at Division 9 will have AI built in — does "Industry Intelligence" mean anything separate? My take: no — Industry Intelligence = the AI inside Industry OS.
4. **REZ Atlas v2 vs the merchant-intelligence-service:** REZ has two parallel intelligence stacks (`rez-merchant-intelligence-service` for the merchant side, `REZ-atlas-v2/atlas-intelligence-*` for the ads/sales side). Per user clarification, **atlas is AdBazaar's product that uses HOJAI Intelligence**. The merchant-intelligence-service is REZ-Merchant's own standalone intelligence. They serve different masters — Atlas is for AdBazaar ad ops, the merchant one is for REZ merchant ops.
5. **Bizora:** Per user clarification, **Bizora is a HOJAI AI standalone product** (like SUTAR OS) — it's the Enterprise AI Workspace. NOT a Company Intelligence. Removed from the Company Intelligence list.
6. **Micro Intelligence library choice:** `opossum` (Node.js circuit breaker) is the obvious pick. Confirm or pick alternative.
